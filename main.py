# we will learn about simple print commands and how error tells our mistakes
print("Hello world")
print("This wil be the first program we wil run in ur course")

# string literal. THis tells us there is something wrong in our string. as we can see we are using two different
# commas to close a string which is not right
print('HEllo")
      
#this will give indentation error(spacing is not right)
 print("Hello")
 
# this will give brackets error which are incomplete in this case
print("hello"
